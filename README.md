# Interpreter

This is an interpreter for an unnamed scripting language developed for use in another project.

To see it in action, clone from github, npm install, and npm test. Interpreter.test.js shows how this library would be used.

To get it in import {Interpreter, StringObj, NumberObj, BoolObj} = require('../Interpreter');
